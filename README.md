## Abstract

This study aimed to explore the relationships between various preoperative factors and survival outcomes in patients undergoing liver surgery. Utilizing a dataset of patient records, we employed multiple regression models, including linear regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to analyze the predictive power of factors like blood clotting scores, liver function tests, age, gender, and alcohol consumption history. We also used visualizations to address the research question.

Our findings indicate that liver function tests and blood clotting scores are significant predictors of survival times. The linear regression model, particularly after a logarithmic transformation of the survival time, showed a high explanatory power. The Random Forest model highlighted the importance of liver function tests, while the SVR model, with an RBF kernel, provided additional insights into both linear and non-linear relationships.

The study's outcomes suggest that comprehensive preoperative evaluations, which include liver function and blood clotting scores, are crucial in predicting post-surgical survival outcomes. These findings have potential implications for clinical decision-making and highlight the value of machine learning techniques in medical prognosis.

Future research directions include exploring more sophisticated models and incorporating a broader range of predictors to enhance the understanding and prediction of survival outcomes post liver surgery.
